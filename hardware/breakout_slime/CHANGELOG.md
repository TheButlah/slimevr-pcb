# Changelog
- **v0.1**: Ordered PCB to test. Tests confirmed that pcb works for MPU, but battery
  polarity reversed, and INT1 pin goes to wrong pad which breaks BNO unless INT pin
  disabled in firmware. Battery polarity was also reversed, requiring installing
  the connector in reverse.
- **v0.1.1**: Filled back ground pour, fixed battery polarity on JST battery connector.
  Fixed INT1 wiring.
- **v0.1.2**: Added a front ground pour, added edge cut on D1 antenna region, added
  keepout on d1 antenna region, added edge cut on battery connector. Added revision
  number to silkscreen.
