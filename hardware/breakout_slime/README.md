# Breakout SlimeVR
This PCB design is intended as the easiest DIY SlimeVR pcb. It is a simple two
layer PCB, and should make assembling SlimeVR significantly easier than using a
protoboard.

**NOTE: This has only been tested on BNOs and MPUs.**
Also, use it at your own risk. I've tested it, but I accept no responsibility for it ;)
